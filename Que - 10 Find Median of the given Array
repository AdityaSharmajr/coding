Problem Statement: Given an unsorted array, find the median of the given array.
Example 1:
Input: [2,4,1,3,5]
Output: 3
Example 2:
Input: [2,5,1,7]
Output: 3.5
Median is defined as the value which is present in the middle for a series of values.
 Note, in order to find the median of an array of integers, we must make sure they are sorted.

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
void MedianArray(vector<int> arr){
    int n = arr.size();
    sort(arr.begin(),arr.end());
        if(n%2 == 0){
            n = n/2;
            double median = double(arr[n] + arr[n-1])/2;
            cout << "Median: " << median;
        }
        else{
            cout << "Median: " << arr[n/2];
        }
    }

int main(){
    
    vector<int> arr = {2,5,1,7};
    MedianArray(arr);
    return 0;
}
